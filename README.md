This is a lightweight custom testing library designed as an alternative to MSTest, NUnit, or xUnit. 
I created it because I wanted a simpler and more customizable solution for representing and managing test data. 
Unlike existing frameworks, this library focuses on straightforward usage and a tailored test output format that better suits my needs.

Currently, itâ€™s minimalistic and not aimed at high performance or sophisticated use cases, making it perfect for my personal projects. 
However, I may expand its features over time as needed.
